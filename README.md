# Dazzler
Source code for Cromemco Dazzler graphics card for Altair 8800.<BR>
See: https://www.hackster.io/david-hansel/dazzler-display-for-altair-simulator-3febc6


## Fork

I forked the project to investigate how to make it run on a Raspberry Pi Zero, as I would like the convenience of plugging it into the USB port on the Altair-Duino and outputting to the HDMI output. So far it's all just hand-waving.
