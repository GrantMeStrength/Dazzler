The magmartini.ptp file is a capture of the input sequence for the
Magenta Martini (created by Steve Dompier) animation.

This was meant to be played back from paper tape on a TeleType, so
it needs to be played back SLOWLY, otherwise some input will be 
missed and the animation does not work.

To play this animation:
- In the AltairDuino's SIO configuration, change the
  "SIO board revision" setting to "Cromemco"
- start DazzleMation on the AltairDuino
- connect via TeraTerm to AltairDuino SIO board
- select "Setup->Serial Port" in TeraTerm and set Transmit Delay
  to at least 50 msec/char
- select "File->Send file..." in TeraTerm, make sure the BINARY
  option is checked, select the magmartini.ptp file and click "Open"
- the animation is constructed slowly as the data is sent
- after construction is finished (cursor moves to center of screen)
  you can use SW15-SW8 to set the animation speed
  (all up except SW8 seems to be a good speed)
