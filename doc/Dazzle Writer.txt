The SW14-SW12 sense switches control the video mode
(Dazzler output register 0Fh):

SW14: up: single-color,    down: multi-color
SW13: up: 2k video memory, down: 512-byte video memory
SW12: up: color,           down: grayscale
SW11: background color (intensity)
SW10: background color (blue)
SW 9: background color (green)
SW 8: background color (red)

Initially all switches should be UP to get a proper picture.
From there you can experiment. Note that if SW14 is down the text
becomes unreadable and if SW13 is down then only the top-left
quadrant is shown.
